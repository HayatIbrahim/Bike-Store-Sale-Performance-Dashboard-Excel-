# Bike-Store-Sale-Performance-Dashboard-(Excel)
l Thrilled to share my comprehensive Bike Store Sales Performance Dashboard created in Excel, featuring three interactive pages that provide deep insights into key business metrics:
Profit Analysis: Dynamic bar charts allow for seamless toggling between top/bottom products and states, offering a clear view of profit performance. Additional charts break down profit by product category, year, weekday, and monthly trends, with KPIs highlighting unit sold, total revenue, profit, COGS, and profit margin.
Revenue Performance: Analyze revenue vs. target with a combined line and column chart, where color coding quickly highlights whether revenue meets or falls short of targets. A waffle chart shows revenue distribution by weekend and weekdays, while other charts compare revenue against averages by quarter, weekday, and year, offering a thorough overview of revenue trends.
Quantity Analysis: This section reveals the story behind product sales, with side-by-side charts comparing top 3 sub-categories by revenue, profit, and quantity sold. It highlights how high-value items like bikes generate substantial revenue and profit despite lower sales volumes, contrasted with high-quantity items like spare parts that contribute less to the bottom line. Additional charts track sales by age group and monthly trends.
This dashboard provides a detailed, data-driven view of bike sales, empowering informed decision-making and strategic planning.
